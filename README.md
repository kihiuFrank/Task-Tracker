# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In this project, I will be building a task tracker app and look at components, props, state, hooks, working with an API and more.
The purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with React Js so I can have the basics of learning Next Js.

I'll be using Next Js to build the front-end for my smart contracts.
